# Belly Button Diversity

## Overview of Project

A dashboard using HTML with Bootstrap stylings and charts made with Plotly. The dashboard showcases the information about bacteria cultures found in anonymized volunteers belly buttons. The horizontal bar chart is of the top 10 bacteria cultures found in a subject's navel, shown with the unique Operation Taxonomical Unit ID number used to label the y-axis against the total number found. Hovering over the bar reveals the complete OTU label for the culture. The bubble plot also visualizes the number of bacteria found in each culture by the relative size of each marker for every culture found for the test subject, and also uses hover text to report the complete OTU taxonomy. The gauge graph reports how often each volunteer washed their belly buttons in a week. A selection box is provided to change the information and charts to a different test subject.
